       <h2>Description to make Sambar</h2>
       <p>In southern states of India namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Sambar is made using different vegetables and fruits along with lentils or coconut.
          Each region has its own version of making sambar; even though the same vegetables are used, the condiments and ingredients, and the method differ regionwise.[10] In Tulu speaking 
          areas of coastal Karnataka coconut is predominantly used to prepare Koddel (Sambar), The grated coconut is ground with spices to form a paste which is added to vegetables boiled.[11]
          In Kannada speaking regions sambar is referred to as Saaru.[12][13]</p>
